# CalculatorGUI

My first attempt at creating a java GUI. I created a basic calculator with simple math operations like such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also has a negate feature and clear feature. The user can click the numbers and use an operation and click equals when completed. The user will have to hit clear if they want to do another calculation. I learned how to use Swing in Java completely on my own through research as well. I have never worked with GUIs before.
